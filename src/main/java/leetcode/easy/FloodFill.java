    // You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
    //To perform a flood fill:
    //
    //Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
    //Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
    //Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
    //The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
    //Return the modified image after performing the flood fill

    //problem: You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.
    //Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them.
    // For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c" .
    //It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key.
    // You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
    //Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
    //only keys 2 - 9 can be mapped to letters
